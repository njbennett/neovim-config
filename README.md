# neovim-config
A base Neovim configuration.
Use it
as a starting point for customization,
or a guide for converting
an existing Vim configuration.

# Installing
Clone the repository
wherever you want to work on it,
and then run `./link` to symlink
the `init.lua` and `lazy-lock.json` files
into the correct places on Mac.

You can also clone directly into your config directory,
which on a Mac is at
```
~/.config/nvim/
```
